                <p><em>System Administrator of <strong>DMMCMHI</strong>, Computer Engineer</em></p>
                <p>I am a <strong>Computer Engineer</strong> whom has this insane knack for
                    gaining knowledge at the wrong place and at the wrong time. I know
                    it made me sound nosy but that's what it is. I love <em>video games</em>, I 
                    specifically herald the Ys series as the best action game there is 
                    and thereof the best game there is to put it bluntly. I love solving problems
                    that it became an addiction, though I heavily procrastinate, I can assure
                    you that I will finish the job by the end of the day. And did I mention that
                    I love math? <em><strong>*looks to the left* *looks to the right*</strong></em>
                    specifically Calculus, I may not be a master of it but I can manage.

    <h3>Where I Learned Stuff</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> : </strong>Believe me or not, this is where I learned
        most of what I know now.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://www.panpacificu.edu.ph/">Panpacific University North Philippines</a> : </strong>This place
        gave me my diploma. That's it.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="http://www.dpwh.gov.ph/dpwh/">DPWH Main</a> : </strong>The only place where I found educational
        meaning in this earth and beyond. They had what it took to teach me a lot
        of stuff, the only problem is that they are not a university <strong>
        but rather a company that governs our structures and roads.
